## General info
This repository stores the empirical project part of my Master Thesis in Data Science and Business Analytics at Faculty of Economic Sciences, University of Warsaw.
The project aims to build a predictive model proposing the odds for teams to win the volleyball match at the beginning and throughout the game, predicting the result after each point.

## Purpose and technology choice
The purpose of this project was to gain an ability to predict the result of the match at any time of the game to bring more insight into sports analytics and potentially use this model for betting. All of the previous approaches focused on one prediction before the game.
The language I selected was R due to its ease of data manipulation and integration with most of the Machine Learning algorithms. Also possibility of using Shiny apps is also handy for the future.

## Technologies
* R
* dplyr
* ggplot2
* corrplot
* randomForest
* caret
